# Network sniffing
Network sniffing is the process of capturing and analyzing data packets that travel through a computer network. A network sniffer (also called a packet sniffer) monitors network traffic in real-time to inspect the data exchanged between devices. It is commonly used by cybersecurity professionals for troubleshooting, network analysis, and detecting unauthorized activities or intrusions.
